In 1794 the U.S. state of Pennsylvania became the first jurisdiction to restrict the death penalty to first-degree murder, and in 1846 the state of Michigan abolished capital punishment for all murders and other common crimes. In 1863 Venezuela became the first country to abolish capital punishment for all crimes, including serious offenses against the state (e.g., treason and military offenses in time of war). San Marino was the first European country to abolish the death penalty, doing so in 1865; by the early 20th century several other countries, including the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Italy, had followed suit (though it was reintroduced in Italy under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini). By the mid-1960s some 25 countries had abolished the death penalty for murder, though only about half of them also had abolished it for offenses against the state or the military code. For example, Britain abolished capital punishment for murder in 1965, but treason, piracy, and military crimes remained capital offenses until 1998.'}\n",

While the Convention doesn’t take a clear stance on the death penalty, many believe executions fall under the type of punishment described in the document. In the United States, research shows that 3% of executions between 1890-2010 were “botched.” What does it mean to “botch” an execution? It causes severe suffering to the prisoner. Lethal injection has the highest rate of error despite being the most “humane” – and most common – option. When injections go wrong, it can take a long time for a prisoner to die. Exams after death show serious chemical burns and other injuries. Opponents of the death penalty say this demonstrates cruel and inhumane punishment.'}\n",

As for racial groups, despite making up only 13% of the US population, black people make up over 40% of the prisoners with a death sentence. When researchers take a deeper dive, they discover patterns of discrimination based on race. According to the United Nations, the poor are also disproportionately affected by the death penalty on a global scale. They are less likely to get good representation and the system is biased against them.

New technologies like DNA testing have played a big role. If timing and circumstances had been different, prisoners would have died for a crime they didn’t commit. How many other death row inmates are at risk for unjust execution? Even if they aren’t all innocent, a deeper dive into their cases could reveal discrimination, inadequate representation, and other issues that would prove they didn’t receive a fair trial.

Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it.'}\n",

The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, throughout the years from 2007 to 2020,[10] eight non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition.[11]\\n'}\n",

State of Uttar Pradesh, February 1979, had interpreted the parameter on which ‘death sentence’ must be related to circumstance of the criminal and not the crime itself.[68] Thirdly, it reviewed the death sentence in the light of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, January 1978 since every punitive action must satisfy the test of reasonableness after satisfying the golden triangle test of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Indian Constitution.[71]\\xa0 The primary challenges to the death penalty in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, May 1980 was that the death punishment is unnecessary, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and the punishment of death sentence does not serve the purpose of deterrence. Furthermore, the constitutional validity of Section 302 of IPC and\\xa0 Section 366(2) of CrPC was challenged in this case on the ground that the imposition of death penalty is arbitrary and whimsical.[72][73] However, the Supreme Court by a majority of 4:1 did not accept this contention and affirmed the constitutional validity of death sentence but propounded the doctrine of ‘rarest of rare’ as that the death sentence can only imposed ‘in\\xa0 the\\xa0 rarest\\xa0 of\\xa0 rare\\xa0 cases\\xa0 when\\xa0 the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed.” Moreover, the Supreme Court ascertained that the “special reasons” in the context of inflicting death sentence must pay due regard to both the crime and criminal and the relative weight has to be given both aggravating and mitigating circumstance prior to the stating of special reasons for inflicting the death sentence.[74]\\xa0The Supreme Court recognized that the mitigating factors includes the mental condition, the age of the accused, the possibility of reforming or that the person committed the crime under the superior orders.[63] The Supreme Court recognized and emphasized on the individual yet principled sentencing of the death sentence,\\xa0 the court refused to create categories, instead provided discretion to the judges to apply the principled reasoning of inflicting death sentence in each individual case on the basis of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\\n'}\n"

State of Punjab, May 1980 judgment.[92] The court reinstated and reemphasized the principles of sentencing policy propounded in the Bachan Singh case. Also, the Court listed the two question that needs to be answered prior to the imposition of death sentence on individual cases. Firstly, is the offence committed so exceptional that there is no scope for awarding any other sentence? Secondly, even when weightage is accorded to the mitigating circumstances does the circumstances still warrants death penalty? It was held that the judges must prepare a balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstance of the crime and criminal and analyze the factors prior to making up choice between death sentence and life imprisonment. However, the Supreme Court held that the death penalty may imposed on the ground where the collective conscience of the society is shocked that expect the judicial authorities impose the death sentence.[63] Thereafter, it listed five categories of the cases, where the death sentence is appropriate. (i) Manner in which the crime was committed: Murder committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or drastic manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community; (ii) Motive behind the criminal act: Murder committed for a motive which evinces total depravity and meanness; (iii) The Nature of the crime: Murder that arouse social wrath (like homicide of a person belonging to SC/ST or a minority community, dowry-death etc.); (iv)The degree of the crime: Multiple murders of a family or a large number of persons of a particular caste, community, or locality; and (v) The Status of the victim: Murder of an innocent child or a helpless woman or a person rendered helpless by old age or infirmity; murder of a person by the murderer who is in a position of domination or trust or murder of a public figure generally loved and respected by the community for the services rendered by him and the murder is committed for political or similar reasons other than personal reasons. It focused more on the ‘crime factors’ or adopted ‘crime centric approach’ on the sentencing policy of the death sentence.[63] Furthermore, it moved towards the practice of balancing aggravating and mitigating circumstances to impose death sentence, where Bachan Singh judgment mandated that death sentence be imposed where life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed. Thus, this precedent and subsequent line of cases had systematically permitted the justification of death sentence on the manner, nature and gravity of the crime, without taking into the account of circumstances of the criminal, in order to exercise judicial discretion on the death sentence.[70]\\n'}\n",

In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of social welfare, of torture and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, Grand Duke Leopold II of Habsburg, the future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the first permanent abolition in modern times. On 30 November 1786, after having de facto blocked executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany\\'s regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating Cities for Life Day. In the United Kingdom, it was abolished for murder (leaving only treason, piracy with violence, arson in royal dockyards and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes) for a five-year experiment in 1965 and permanently in 1969, the last execution having taken place in 1964. It was abolished for all peacetime offences in 1998.[56]\\n'}\n",

The Convention on the Rights of the Child(CRC) also lays down provisions on similar lines stating that no child (person below eighteen years of age) can be subjected to torture or other cruel treatment such as life imprisonment without possibility of release.[130] The Convention against Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment or the Torture Convention itself does not declare death penalty as torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment but addresses the methods of execution and the process of death row.[131][63][132] Among the above mentioned treaties and conventions India has ratified the ICCPR and CRC and is only a signatory of the Torture Convention. But according to Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties the state is bound to refrain from acts which would defeat the purpose of a treaty.[133]  Under the domestic laws, The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1994 in Section 2(1)(d) states that, “human rights” means the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India.[134][135] Additionally Section 2(1)(f) states that, “International Covenants” means the ICCPR.[136] Reading together Sections 2(1)(d) and 2(1)(f) it can be said the ICCPR has been incorporated into the given statute protecting human rights.[63]\\n'}\n",

State of Maharashtra, April 2009 and Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra, April 2013.[144][94][97]  The commission extensively studied various aspects of death penalty such as a role of deterrence, uniform applicability of guidelines, victim justice and concluded that the punishment should be abolished except for in the matters of terrorism.  The Commission concluded after studying the issue extensively that the death penalty does not serve the penological goal of deterrence any more than life imprisonment.  It was opined that it fails to achieve any constitutionally valid penological goals.  The Law Commission also concluded that in focusing on the death penalty as the ultimate measure of justice to victims, the restorative and rehabilitative aspects of justice are lost sight of.[18]  The discretionary power of judges and uneven application of Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, May 1980 in these cases goes against the constitutional principles and principle of equality making the whole process arbitrary and subjective to whims of the judges. The commission also identified some systematic impediments such as lack of resources, outdated modes of investigation, over-stretched police force, ineffective prosecution, and poor legal aid making the administration of the death penalty vulnerable to errors. The commission also concluded that constitutional and statutory safeguards such as Article 72 and Article 161 have also failed to safeguard the rights from these impediments.[145][50][144] With relation to supporting death for those convicted in terror cases and for waging war against the country, the Report admitted that there is no valid penological justification for treating terrorism differently from other crimes, but the concern of the times seems to be that removing of the death penalty for these offences will affect national security.\\n'}\n",

Another major finding was that 76% of the prisoners belonged to a backward community.[161] The Report also found that of over 1700 prisoners who were sentenced to death by trial courts in the period 2000-2015, the appellate courts ultimately confirmed only 4.5% of the sentences. Nearly 30% of the prisoners went from being sentenced to death to being acquitted of all charges while nearly 65% of the death sentences were commuted to life sentences.\\n'}\n",

The friend herself is no stranger to the system since her husband was incarcerated as well. We are sitting in a four by four feet room, right beside a petrol pump in the middle of a slum. “This room is the only thing my mother has left me. My father died an alcoholic and so did my husband. Only my brother, God bless his soul, helps us. I have no one to rely on except my son.”\"}\n",

After the American Revolution (1775–1783), some states went further by adopting death penalty statutes similar to those of Pennsylvania, which in 1682 had limited its death penalty to treason and murder. New York built its first penitentiary in 1796. With a place to house burglars and nonviolent criminals, the state reduced its capital offenses from 13 to two. Other states followed suit by constructing large jails and cutting their capital offenses to just a few of the worst crimes.'}\n",

At the time of the murders, Williams was a leading figure in the notorious and violent Crips gang in Los Angeles, California. During his decades on death row he became an outspoken critic of gangs and wrote books encouraging children to avoid gangs and violence. For his work he received nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. His supporters included Hollywood celebrities who lobbied the California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (1947–) for clemency, arguing that Williams had redeemed himself while in prison. The governor refused, noting that Williams had never expressed remorse for his crimes. He was executed in December 2005.'}\n"

At the end of the year, more states had abolished the death penalty or gone ten years without an execution, more counties had elected reform prosecutors who pledged never to seek the death penalty or to use it more sparingly; fewer new death sentences were imposed than in any prior year since the Supreme Court struck down U.S. death penalty laws in 1972; and despite a six-month spree of federal executions without parallel in the 20th or 21st centuries, fewer executions were carried out than in any year in nearly three decades.'}\n",

The Gallup poll found public support for the death penalty near a half-century low, with opposition at its highest level since the 1960s.

Trials posed health risks not only to jurors and court personnel, but to defense and prosecution lawyers and investigators, witnesses, mental health experts, and their families. Attitudes towards the pandemic affected which jurors appeared for service and, with the racially imbalanced health impact of COVID-19, threatened to make capital juries even less representative of the community. The impact of COVID-19 health risks on the thoroughness and quality of capital defense representation remains to be seen. In a year with very few death sentences due to a global pandemic, it is already evident that a significant number of the death sentences imposed in 2020 paint a troubling picture of the legal process.'}\n",

A DPIC analysis of Supreme Court death-penalty decisions since 2014 found that Justice Ginsburg had provided a vote in favor of death-row prisoners in every case in which the Court overturned a capital conviction or death sentence and in every instance in which the Court granted a stay of execution.
